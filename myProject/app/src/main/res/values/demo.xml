        <item>Summoned to another world to slay the mighty beast…of governance! (And soon to be an anime!) When Kazuya Souma is unexpectedly transported to another world, he knows the people expect a hero. But Souma\'s idea of heroism is more practical than most—he wants to rebuild the flagging economy of the new land he\'s found himself in!
